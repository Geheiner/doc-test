(34) When end-users who are natural persons have provided their consent to receiving direct marketing
communications , they should still be able to withdraw their consent at any time in an easy manner and
without any cost to them.
To facilitate effective enforcement of Union rules on direct marketing communications, it is necessary to
prohibit the masking of the identity and the use of false identities, false return addresses or numbers while
sending direct marketing communications .
Direct marketing communications should therefore be clearly recognizable as such and should indicate the
identity of the legal or the natural person sending the communication and, where applicable, on whose behalf
the communication is sent and provide the necessary information for end-users who are natural persons to
exercise their right to withdraw their consent to receiving further direct marketing communications, such as
valid contact details (e.g.link, e-mail address) which can be easily used by end-users who are natural
persons to withdraw their consent free of charge.

(35) In order to allow easy withdrawal of consent, legal or natural persons conducting direct marketing
communications by email should present a link, or a valid electronic mail address, which can be easily used
by end-users to withdraw their consent.

Legal or natural persons conducting direct marketing communications through voice-tovoice calls and through
calls by automating calling and communication systems should display their identity line on which the company
can be called or present a specific code identifying the fact that the call is a marketing call.

(36) Voice-to-voice direct marketing calls that do not involve the use of automated calling and communication
systems, given that they are more costly for the sender and impose no financial costs on end-users.

Member States should therefore be able to establish and or maintain national systems only allowing such calls
to end-users who have not objected.

(37) Service providers who offer electronic communications services should inform endusers of measures they
can take to protect the security of their communications for instance by using specific types of software or
encryption technologies.

The requirement to inform end-users of particular security risks does not discharge a service provider from
the obligation to take, at its own costs, appropriate and immediate measures to remedy any new, unforeseen
security risks and restore the normal security level of the service.

The provision of information about security risks to the subscriber should be free of charge.

Security is appraised in the light of Article 32 of Regulation (EU) 2016/679.

(38) To ensure full consistency with Regulation (EU) 2016/679, the enforcement of the provisions of this
Regulation should be entrusted to the same authorities responsible for the enforcement of the provisions
Regulation (EU) 2016/679 and this Regulation relies on the consistency mechanism of Regulation (EU) 2016/679.

Member States should be able to have more than one supervisory authority, to reflect their constitutional,
organisational and administrative structure.

The supervisory authorities should also be responsible for monitoring the application of this Regulation
regarding electronic communications data for legal entities.

Such additional tasks should not jeopardise the ability of the supervisory authority to perform its tasks
regarding the protection of personal data under Regulation (EU) 2016/679 and this Regulation.

Each supervisory authority should be provided with the additional financial and human resources, premises and
infrastructure necessary for the effective performance of the tasks under this Regulation.

(39) Each supervisory authority should be competent on the territory of its own Member State to exercise the
powers and to perform the tasks set forth in this Regulation.

In order to ensure consistent monitoring and enforcement of this Regulation throughout the Union, the
supervisory authorities should have the same tasks and effective powers in each Member State, without
prejudice to the powers of prosecutorial authorities under Member State law, to bring infringements of this
Regulation to the attention of the judicial authorities and engage in legal proceedings.

Member States and their supervisory authorities are encouraged to take account of the specific needs of
micro, small and medium-sized enterprises in the application of this Regulation.

(40) In order to strengthen the enforcement of the rules of this Regulation, each supervisory authority
should have the power to impose penalties including administrative fines for any infringement of this
Regulation, in addition to, or instead of any other appropriate measures pursuant to this Regulation.

This Regulation should indicate infringements and the upper limit and criteria for setting the related
administrative fines, which should be determined by the competent supervisory authority in each individual
case, taking into account all relevant circumstances of the specific situation, with due regard in particular
to the nature, gravity and duration of the infringement and of its consequences and the measures taken to
ensure compliance with the obligations under this Regulation and to prevent or mitigate the consequences of
the infringement.

For the purpose of setting a fine under this Regulation, an undertaking should be understood to be an
undertaking in accordance with Articles 101 and 102 of the Treaty.

(41) In order to fulfil the objectives of this Regulation, namely to protect the fundamental rights and
freedoms of natural persons and in particular their right to the protection of personal data and to ensure
the free movement of personal data within the Union, the power to adopt acts in accordance with Article 290
of the Treaty should be delegated to the Commission to supplement this Regulation.

In particular, delegated acts should be adopted in respect of the information to be presented, including by
means of standardised icons in order to give an easily visible and intelligible overview of the collection of
information emitted by terminal equipment, its purpose, the person responsible for it and of any measure the
end-user of the terminal equipment can take to minimise the collection.

Delegated acts are also necessary to specify a code to identify direct marketing calls including those made
through automated calling and communication systems.

It is of particular importance that the Commission carries out appropriate consultations and that those
consultations be conducted in accordance with the principles laid down in the Interinstitutional Agreement on
Better Law-Making of 13 April 20168.

In particular, to ensure equal participation in the preparation of delegated acts, the European Parliament
and the Council receive all documents at the same time as Member States' experts, and their experts
systematically have access to meetings of Commission expert groups dealing with the preparation of delegated
acts.

Furthermore, in order to ensure uniform conditions for the implementation of this Regulation, implementing
powers should be conferred on the Commission when provided for by this Regulation.

Those powers should be exercised in accordance with Regulation (EU) No 182/2011.

(42) Since the objective of this Regulation, namely to ensure an equivalent level of protection of natural
and legal persons and the free flow of electronic communications data throughout the Union, cannot be
sufficiently achieved by the Member States and can rather, by reason of the scale or effects of the action,
be better achieved at Union level, the Union may adopt measures, in accordance with the principle of
subsidiarity as set out in Article 5 of the Treaty on European Union.

In accordance with the principle of proportionality as set out in that Article, this Regulation does not go
beyond what is necessary in order to achieve that objective.

(43) Directive 2002/58/EC should be repealed.

HAVE ADOPTED THIS REGULATION: 8 Interinstitutional Agreement between the European Parliament, the Council of
the European Union and the European Commission on Better Law-Making of 13 April 2016 (OJ L 123, 12.5.2016,
p.1–14).
